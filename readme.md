# Mater
Culinary adventures are great fun, and if shopping for ingredients is part of your adventure, Mater is just for you! With Mater, you can:
- Follow your recipes
- Add new recipes
- View your shopping list created from your recipe ingredients
- Change units for your recipes at any time
- Add meal reminders

## Play Store
You can download Mater on the Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gerardbradshaw.mater)

## Building from Source
You can also build the releases from the source for added security or beta versions.

Start by getting a copy of the master branch. You can download it from [Github](https://github.com/GerardBradshaw/Mater/tree/master) or clone it by running:
```shell
git clone -b master https://github.com/GerardBradshaw/Mater
```

## Future Work
The next steps for Mater are:
- Cloud backup
- Custom shopping list items (not associated with a recipe)
